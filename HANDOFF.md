# Handoff — current release-integrity status (2026-10-20)

**This top section supersedes all earlier handoff instructions below.** Current branch is `arena/6a00f308-gemsdoe70`. Decision: **STOP; no TIFF cleared for download or submission**. Historical TIFF/ZIP files were moved out of the Pages tree into `quarantine/published-downloads-2026-10-20/`. No weekly slot was used. Read `README.md`, `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `reports/review-release-integrity-2026-10-20.md`, `evidence/release_hold.json`, then the historical sections below for context only. Do not follow older instructions below that say an artifact is downloadable or recommend new lane work before resolving this release hold.

The hold is justified by candidate identity conflicts, empty registry values in a run card that asserted promotion, and an incomplete uniqueness witness with 1.0 forward dot overlap. Full software suite after fail-closed updates: 144 passed, 3 existing Rasterio deprecation warnings. This is software validation, not a scientific score.

# Historical handoff — 2026-10-20 (session 2, branch arena/9fe83934-gemsdoe70)

Read README.md, PROJECT_BRIEF.md, this file and `docs/irregularities.md` first.

## State

* **Artifact published:** `docs/downloads/gems70-p4-stratified-halo-37654-20261020.tif`
  (126,097 bytes, sha256 `0fd1ad9ef58c9bbe0ed1781d36a31f76424db11930502623153dd69581ab35e7`),
  plus a one-TIFF ZIP and the writer receipt.
* **Verdict: negative.** `download_ok = true`, `submit_recommended = false`.
  The pre-registered target-like gate (instrument B′) is 12.6 % below the H33 reference with a
  95 % CI excluding zero. Instrument A and the unrestricted proxy favour the candidate.
* **No weekly slot used. No organizer-confirmed score exists in this repository.**

## What was done

1. **Two defects in the shared uniqueness tool were found and fixed** (reported, hashes in
   `registry/template_pin.json` with `all_identical: false`, full text in
   `evidence/upstream_fix_report.md`):
   * dots are binary (`|value − 1| < 1e-6`), not every positive value;
   * duplication requires **mutual** overlap; forward-only overlap fires at 1.00 on three archived
     dense lattices whose 3-px halos cover the whole footprint.
2. **Three preregistered experiments.**
   * Exp 2 (geophysically gated continuation prior): A 0.0591, B 0.0432 — the four-field
     geophysical gate hurt and was removed.
   * Exp 3 (damage-zone intensity): A 0.0873, B 0.1098, B′ 0.0471 — concentration wasted mass
     because `T` saturates per truth cell while `S` scales per dot.
   * Exp 4 (coverage-stratified halo, weak tilt): A 0.0730, B 0.0948, B′ 0.0812 — best balance;
     this is the published artifact.
3. The site was rebuilt to read every number from JSON receipts and to state the download/submit
   decision explicitly on the landing page.

## Do not

* Do not relabel the artifact as promoted, and do not edit the card's gates.
* Do not describe 0.2778 or 0.44 as organizer-confirmed; both are user-supplied.
* Do not remove the two uniqueness fixes without replacing them upstream in the shared template.
* Do not publish any TIFF/ZIP other than the three files named by the run card —
  `release.assert_no_public_rasters` enforces this.

## Next session, in order

1. Supervised within-halo ranking on the SGMC off-catalogue proxy with leave-one-quadrant-out.
   Features: 19-band stack, `lidar_scarp_features_u8` (12 bands), `geodawn_rad_u8` (K/Th/U/TC and
   ratios), catalogue geometry (distance, side, host length, tip position), and the measured
   coverage stratification (7×7 strata, 5-px NMS) which was worth +70 % on B′ at fixed mass.
2. Quantify SGMC duplication against QFaults (buffer tests 1–6 px) so instrument B/B′ can be
   improved or replaced by a genuinely independent additional-fault set.
3. Upstream the two uniqueness fixes to the template repository and run its suite.
4. Only then spend a slot, and record the returned score as ORGANIZER-CONFIRMED.

## Reproduce

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.lock
.venv/bin/python scripts/restore_data.py
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/60GEMSDOE /tmp/60GEMSDOE
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_experiment_v4.py
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_site.py && .venv/bin/python scripts/build_readme.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q          # 118 passed at handoff
```

Large inputs and the registry clone stay outside Git (`.cache/`, `/tmp`). Published evidence is
JSON plus the 126 KB artifact.

## Parallel E2/E3 lane integrated 2026-10-20 (branch arena/ef718aa0-gemsdoe70, PR #16)

Independent preregistered lane merged after session 2: E2 alluvial-step candidate
`gems70-e2-alluvialstep-38000-20261020T221218Z-zeros-DO-NOT-SUBMIT.tif`
(sha256 `91f3dac071a87dc6258b907f5971987b2a8cf0f94e45e008badd8e09522c9d6c`, 38,000 dots,
registered in `registry/published_artifacts.json`). Verdict **negative**; download-for-selector-review
only, submit NO. Catalogue HOLDOUT-DTI 0.06465 [0.04869,0.08181] (11,321 withheld) beats random,
loses to D28 0.09192; independently replicates Instrument-A H33 = 0.0037. E3 depth-step null.
Uniqueness for E2 was measured pre-fix under disclosed R1 on a 7-raster subset
(rho <= 0.039, R1 overlap <= 0.443) — rerun under the corrected mutual rule + complete scan
before any slot consideration. Evidence: `evidence/e2/`, `evidence/e3/`,
`docs/preregistration-e2.md`, `docs/publication-amendment-e2.md`. Organizer pages fetched
2026-10-20: public leader 0.4413 (`evidence/leaderboard_read.json`). No slot used.

## Integration note (PR #16 second merge, 2026-10-20)
PR #18 (H2 stepover-relay, negative; HOLDOUT-DTI 0.023034, lane stop fired) landed during PR #16 CI and replaced `evidence/run_card.json`, builders and 4 test files with its fail-closed system. Integration preserved: H2 card moved byte-identical to `evidence/history/h2_stepover_negative/run_card.json`; H2 diagnostic TIFF registered in `registry/published_artifacts.json`; Phase-4 canonical card restored from `fefc857` blob (sha256 `9cd64b1e...`); session-2 builders/tests retained so P4 + discordance + E2 artifacts stay coherent. `make_run_card.py` stale-schema fix (pre-existing red Verify on main) retained. All verdicts negative; slots used 0.
